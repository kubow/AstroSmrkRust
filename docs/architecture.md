## Algorithms:

- Ephemeris Data: Utilize pre-computed data for planetary positions (e.g., DE430, JPL Horizons).
- Orbital Mechanics: For more complex calculations, implement algorithms like Kepler's equations or numerical integration.

## Basic Functions:

- Adjust time
- Changing positions
- Computed objects
- Optimization (calculation performance)


## Coordinate Systems:

- equatorial 
- ecliptic
- horizontal
