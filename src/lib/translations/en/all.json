The entire source code is openly shared on the platform {github}. We are trying to document it as well as possible to make it as easy as possible to modify individual components.<br /> For our own development, we have chosen the programming language {rust} (specifically the subset {tauri}), which allows integration with powerful libraries of the {python} programming language and, on the other hand, enables precise positioning of individual components using JavaScript (in our case, the programming language {sveltekit}).",
